  - Noise tolerance observations for the different Quantized weight sets
  - Implemented Additive noise injection training on 1- bit adder

2.Implemented Technique:
  - Calculate the standard devation of the noise to be added to the each layer using the equation S.D= W(max in the layer) * Noise factor.
  - Add the noise in the STE only in the forward pass. And saved the actual weights to do the weight updation in the backward pass.
  - Used the quantised weights from the previous code as base weights.
  - In backward pass the weight updation is done to the non noisy weights.

3. Key findings and Results:
  - Improved the noise tolerance upto 20% for some weight sets.
  - Difficulties found in training some weight sets Not able to converge.

4. Next steps:
  - Finding the non quantised weight range for the flat loss region
  - Introducing temporal conductance drift .
